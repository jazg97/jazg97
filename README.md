# Hello, I'm José Zapana-García

Machine Learning Engineer & Researcher | Full-Stack ML Deployment | Applied AI

I build and deploy Machine Learning systems end-to-end:  
From data pipelines → model training → backend APIs → user interfaces.

I come from a strong research background in generative models and signal/image analysis, and I'm transitioning into industry roles focused on building **production-grade AI systems**.

---

### Technical Focus

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (GANs, RL, Transfer Learning, Transformers)
- End-to-End AI systems: model training → API deployment → frontend UI
- Image & signal processing (OpenCV, scikit-image)
- Applied optimization, control systems & scientific computing

---

### Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Tech |
|---|---|---|
| **TrafficSignalControl-RL** | Reinforcement Learning agent to optimize urban traffic flow in SUMO | PyTorch, PPO/Rainbow, Traci |
| **ACWGAN-SN PRPD Generator** | Synthetic PRPD pattern generation with conditional GANs | PyTorch, OpenCV, PRPD features |
| **WhatsApp LLM Chatbot** | LLaMA/OpenAI-based assistant with FastAPI backend | FastAPI, Webhooks, LLM Inference |
| **Lung Ultrasound Classifier** | Feature extraction + model training for artifact detection | PyTorch, scikit-image |

🔗 Repos with ⭐ will soon include deployed demos & documentation.

### Currently Working On

- Deploying PRPD GAN model for live demo (HuggingFace + Gradio)
- Building UI dashboard for RL traffic control results (React + FastAPI)
- Publishing cleaned & production-ready repositories

---

### Experience Summary

- Generative modeling (WGAN-GP, ACWGAN-SN, ACGAN)
- Reinforcement Learning for traffic control
- NLP chat assistants for WhatsApp Business API
- Scientific & industrial AI applications
