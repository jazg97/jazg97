# Hello, I'm José Zapana-García 👋

**Data & Machine Learning Analyst | Applied ML | Production AI Systems**

I design and deploy **end-to-end Machine Learning systems** that turn real data into decisions — from data pipelines and model training to APIs and user-facing demos.

I come from a strong research background in **generative models and signal/image analysis**, and I currently focus on **applied ML, analytics, and production-grade AI systems**.
